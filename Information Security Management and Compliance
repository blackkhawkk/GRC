ISO/IEC 27001:
=============
The strategic planning, execution, and continuous administration of security measures are all part of Information Security (IS) management, which protects information assets from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, interruption, alteration, and destruction. It involves risk assessment and identification, security controls and procedures development, incident response planning, and security awareness training. Contrarily, compliance refers to observing information security-related legal, regulatory, contractual, and industry-specific standards. In IS management and compliance, we will go through two key standards.
ISO/IEC 27001

ISO 27001 is an internationally recognised standard for requirements to plan, develop, run, and update an organisation's Information Security Management System (ISMS). The official ISO/IEC 27001 documents are paid for and can be purchased from this link. It was developed by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and has the following core components:

    1. Scope: This specifies the ISMS's boundaries, including the covered assets and processes.
    2. Information security policy: A high-level document defining an organisation's information security approach.
    3. Risk assessment: Involves identifying and evaluating the risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organisation's information.
    4. Risk treatment: Involves selecting and implementing controls to reduce the identified risks to an acceptable level.
    5. Statement of Applicability (SoA): This document specifies which controls from the standard are applicable and which are not.
    6. Internal audit: This involves conducting periodic audits of the ISMS to ensure that it is operating effectively.
    7. Management review: Review the performance of ISMS at regular intervals.



An ISMS built on the ISO 27001 standard requires careful design and execution. It entails exhaustively evaluating the organisation's security procedures, detecting gaps, and conducting a thorough risk assessment. Access control, incident response, etc., are just a few examples of the areas where clear rules and processes must be created and aligned with ISO 27001 requirements. Leadership support and resource allocation are also essential for the ISMS to be implemented successfully. Regular monitoring, measurement, and continual development are crucial to guarantee the efficacy and continued alignment of the ISMS with the organization's objectives.



Service Organisation Control 2 (SOC 2):
=====================================
SOC 2 was developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) as a compliance/auditing framework. It focuses on assessing the efficacy of a company's data security based on the CIA triad. SOC 2 can reassure customers, stakeholders, and business partners that the company has put sufficient controls in place to safeguard its systems, data, and sensitive information.

The SOC 2 framework is essential for service providers interacting with client data or offering solutions that process, store, or transmit sensitive data. It assists businesses in demonstrating their dedication to upholding strict privacy and security standards. Customers frequently ask for SOC 2 reports or use them as a competitive advantage to guarantee clients that their information will be handled securely. You can learn more about it here.

Important Cardinals:
====================
   1.  SOC 2 is an auditing standard that evaluates the usefulness of a service organisation's controls related to confidentiality, availability, integrity, and privacy.
   2.  Independent auditors conduct SOC 2 audits to determine that security controls meet the relevant criteria.
   3.  SOC 2 reports provide valuable information to customers, stakeholders, and regulators on a service organisation's security and privacy practices. They can be used to demonstrate that the service organisation has adequate controls to protect the data and systems it uses to process customers' information. For example, a cloud computing company that provides infrastructure services to other businesses may undergo a SOC 2 audit to demonstrate its adequate controls to protect customer data stored on its servers. The audit may cover physical security, network security, data encryption, backup and recovery, and employee training and awareness.
   4.  The SOC 2 audit report will assess the controls in place at the cloud computing company and include any findings or recommendations for improvement. The information can be shared with customers and other stakeholders to ensure the company takes appropriate measures to protect its data and systems.

What Information Security Protection SOC 2 provides?
======================================================
The primary purpose of the SOC 2 audit is to ensure that third-party service providers store and process sensitive information securely. 

Planning and Undergoing a SOC 2 Audit:
======================================
The following steps can be taken by an organisationâ€™s management team before and during an audit:

    1. Determine the scope: This may include specific systems, processes, or locations that are relevant to the security and privacy of customer data.
    2. Choose a suitable auditor: Select a qualified auditor with experience conducting SOC 2 audits for financial companies. Consider factors such as the auditor's reputation, experience, and availability.
    3. Plan the audit: Work with the auditor to plan the audit, including the audit timeline, the scope of the audit, and the audit criteria.
    4. Prepare for the audit: Prepare for the audit by reviewing your security and privacy controls, policies, and procedures. Identify any gaps or deficiencies and develop a plan to address them.
    5. Conduct the audit: The auditor will review your controls and conduct testing to assess their effectiveness. The audit may include interviews with key personnel, documentation reviews, and controls tests.
    6. Receive the audit report: Once the audit is complete, the auditor will provide a report detailing the audit results. The report may include a description of your controls, any deficiencies or gaps identified, and recommendations for improvement.
